# College_Football_Ranking_Algorithm
### Attempting to create an objective way to rank college football teams.

The College Football Playoff takes the four best teams in college football and puts them head to head to crown a champion. The problem is, who the best four teams are is up to a panel of college football "experts," leaving a lot of room for personal opinion and underlying bias. My solution is to create an algorithm that ranks all college football teams based on the regular season in order to determine who the top four teams in the country truly are. This would eliminate all controversy regarding who gets in because there will be nothing to blame except the numbers. I know my algorithm is not the perfect algorithm, but it is certainly a basic outline for something that could be used in the future.
